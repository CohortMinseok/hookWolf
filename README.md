## What is it ?
This tool was inspired by Hook Shark, but partially still.
The purpose is to detect hooks in a process made via IAT/EAT and INLINE, this will only work for modules without a packer (protectors like themida/VMP/Enigma and others).
The basis for this to work is to compare modules at runtime with modules stored at their source location.

:warning: [NOTE] this project is still in the BETA phase, it may present problems when trying to analyze some modules, such as crash or fail in some cases. that's why I count on the contribution of anyone who can help improve this tool.
